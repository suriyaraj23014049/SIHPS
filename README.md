## Idea

Objective:
Create an e-Portal to streamline case management for the Delhi High Court, automating case filing, tracking, and processing to enhance efficiency and reduce paperwork.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

Objective:
Develop an e-Portal to streamline and automate case management for the Delhi High Court, integrating key functions into a unified system.

Solution Overview:

**1.User Interface:**
Frontend: Build a user-friendly interface with React or Angular for easy navigation and interaction.

**2.Authentication:**
Secure Login: Use OAuth2 and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for secure access and role-based permissions.

**3.Case Filing:**
Online Submission: Allow users to file cases online and upload documents with automatic case number generation.

**4.Caveat Matching:**
Automated System: Match caveats to cases using algorithms and notify users of matches.

**5.Case Allocation:**
Automatic Allocation: Assign cases to judges or departments based on rules; include manual override options.

**6.Case Tracking:**
Real-Time Updates: Track and update case proceedings in real-time with automated notifications for key events.

**7.Notice Generation:**
Templates: Generate and dispatch notices using predefined templates.


## Use Cases
**1.User Authentication:**
Role-based access control and secure login.

**2.Case Filing:**
Online submission of cases and documents with automatic case number generation.

**3.Caveat Matching:**
Automated matching of caveats to cases with notification alerts.

**4.Case Allocation:**
Automatic and manual allocation of cases to judges or departments.

**5.Case Tracking:**
Real-time updates on case proceedings and automated notifications.

**6.Notice Generation:**
Template-based notice creation and automated dispatch.

**7.Case Transfer:**
Online request submission and approval workflow for case transfers.

**8.Case Status Search and Reporting:**
Advanced search options and customizable reports on case metrics.

**9.Technology Stack:**
*Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React or Angular.
*Backend: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), or Java (Spring Boot).
*Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
*Cloud Services: AWS or Azure.



## Technology Stack

•Frontend: React or Angular

•Backend: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), or Java (Spring Boot)

•Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB

•Cloud Services: AWS or Azure


## Dependencies

**1. Frontend:**

•Frameworks/Libraries: React or Angular for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

•Styling: CSS or pre-processors like SASS for styling; Bootstrap or Material-UI for UI components.

**2. Backend:**

•Server Framework: Node.js with Express, Python with Django or Flask, or Java with Spring Boot for building the server-side logic.

•APIs: RESTful APIs or GraphQL for communication between frontend and backend.
**3. Database:**

•Database System: MySQL or PostgreSQL for relational data management, or MongoDB for a NoSQL approach.

•ORM: Sequelize for Node.js, Django ORM for Python, or Hibernate for Java to interact with the database.
**4. Authentication and Security:**
•Authentication Libraries: OAuth2 libraries for secure authentication, e.g., Passport.js for Node.js or Django Allauth for Python.

•Security Tools: Libraries for handling encryption, secure data storage, and compliance (e.g., Helmet.js for Node.js).
**5. Document Management:**
•Document Storage: Cloud storage services like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage for storing case files and documents.

•Document Processing: Libraries for document processing and handling (e.g., PDF.js for rendering PDFs).
**6. Notification System:**

•Notification Services: Integration with email services (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) and SMS gateways (e.g., Twilio) for sending notifications.
**7. Deployment and Hosting:**

•Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform for hosting the application.

•Containerization: Docker for containerizing the application, and Kubernetes for orchestration if needed.
**8. Development and Collaboration Tools:**

•Version Control: Git for version control, with platforms like GitHub or GitLab for repository management.

•CI/CD: Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment.
**9. Testing:**

•Testing Frameworks: Jest or Mocha for JavaScript, PyTest for Python, or JUnit for Java for unit and integration testing.

•End-to-End Testing: Selenium or Cypress for automated end-to-end testing.
**10. Documentation:**

•Documentation Tools: Swagger for API documentation, and tools like Docusaurus or MkDocs for project documentation.


These dependencies will help in building, deploying, and maintaining the e-Portal effectively.
